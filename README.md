## Hello
I'm Vidmancer, the indie game developer behind File Under Kingdom, my first Steam game!

What was initially going to be a puzzle game has turned into a kind of city builder and interactive story, where how you build the kingdom alters events and/or choices of its leaders. You can find more details on the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851120/File_Under_Kingdom/).
