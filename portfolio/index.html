<h2>File Under Kingdom – Steam 2022</h2>
<p>My biggest project to date has been File Under Kingdom, a city builder/puzzle game with a branching story tied to how the player builds their kingdom. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851120/File_Under_Kingdom/">Steam</a>.</p>

 <p> I handled the design, programming, and story for File Under Kingdom. The artwork was pulled from various online resources as well as the music and sound effects, I have a list of credits on my main <a href="https://vidmancer.com/">page</a>.</p>
